# stock-analysis-Analyzing stocks with VBA

## Overview of Project

  The purpose of this analyis was to help Steve figure out which stocks his parents should invest in.
His goal is to analyze a spreadsheet with a number of different given stocks, labeled with their 
respective volumes of **stocks traded**, their **opening dates**, and their **highest** and **lowest** values traded.
I wrote different VBA scripts to automate calculations for each stock's **starting prices**, their **ending prices**,
and their **total daily volumes**, as well as each of their **return values**. This data workbook, along with their
VBA *macros*, aimed to assist Steve in deciding which stocks would be best for his parents to invest in.
